# UFOs

The technologies used in this challenge included JavaScript for the creation of filtered data, and display of information through the use of functions in app.js, as well as HTML and CSS files for the display and styling of the website. The purpose of the project included the deployment of a website in which data is filtered to present the user with UFO occurrences in the US on specific dates, cities, states, and the given shapes of these UFO events. Through the filtering of information it is apparent that two improvements should be made:

1. Elimination of the country filter: This filter serves very little purpose as the data presented does not involve data from other countries. It would be best to not include the filter and state in the website the data only includes US data. 
2. Creation of a scrape button to continuously upload data would be useful in this project. It would provide continous flow of information into the website as opposed to depending on the data in data.js. 
3. Refining of the shape filter: The shape filter is helpful, however it would best if some drop down options were available as well as adding the option to indicate "any" shape. This would help the user refine the information they are searching a little further.
